So, you have a git branch named **BESTBRANCH** and you have basically made it your master branch?

If you want to get back on track, and make master be identical to BESTBRANCH, do this :

```bash
# Go to BESTBRANCH
git checkout BESTBRANCH 

# Take master things into BESTBRANCH, 
# but let BESTBRANCH "win" over master
git merge -s ours master 

# Take bestbranch into master
git checkout master 
git merge BESTBRANCH
``` 

Voilla! Now master is best.
