Standsup can become a chore without an obvious value. Either 1) because I work very tightly with the team. I care about what they do, and know what they're doing today. We hold each other accountable on progress through frequent interaction. Or 2) Because I am too stressed around my own tasks. I "don't have the time" to hear about others plans and their progress. If this is the case, I could need a timeout and reminder on why we do standups:

1.  Telling people I trust **my goals for today**, helps me focus and motivated to do those things.

2.  Saying **what I accomplished yesterday**, keep me accountable and give weight to stating those goals.

3.  Asking for help to remove **any blockers**, allow us to help maintain speed, rather than staying stuck.

Having standups also allow me to feel involved in what happens within the team and what we make. I get the opportunity to give input (after the standup) to areas of the product before they are implemented. We become a team, and prevent us sliding into a group of individual developers.

Mistakes I have done includes

*   **Being unclear about whether I accomplished yesterdays goals.** This removes accountability when stating goals.

*   **Start talking in depth** about a problem I've encountered, why I didn't accomplish goals, or things other than the 3 points above. This contribute to standups feeling ineffective, boring or feeling related to guilt. 

*   **Not listening**, but instead thinking about what I am going to say. If I tend to do this, I should write down the 3 points before the standup.
