1. Create a file .pythonrc in `~/.pythonrc`
    
```python
# enable syntax completion
try:
    import readline
except ImportError:
    print("Module readline not available.")
else:
    import rlcompleter
    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete") 
```
        
2. Export it by adding thisÂ export to yourÂ profile file (if you use zsh, append to ~/.zprofile instead)
   
```bash
echo "export PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pythonrc" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Tada! After having reopened your terminal window, you should now get 
autocomplete when opennig up `python`

### Virtualenv

Want it in virutalenv? Append it to your activate file instead of your profile

```bash
echo "export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc" >> ./env/bin/activate
```
