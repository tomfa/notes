1.  Open devtools
2.  Select **Profiles**
3.  Select **Collect JavaScript CPU Profile**
4.  Click **Start**
5.  Do the (typically slow) things you wish to record
6.  Click **Stop**

You now got a table of functions, and CPU time they consumed. On the right hand side of the table, you got a link to the js file and its line number of the function that is responsible for this. You can click them to open the files in the Sources tab.
