As a person working with different people indifferent repos, mixing up npm with yarn and inconsistent
script names to start the project really grinds my gears. 

- Do I run npm install or yarn install? 
- Did someone just add a package-lock.json to a yarn repo?
- Do I run yarn dev, yarn start, yarn start:dev or yarn start:all to fire up the dev server?
- Did linting/build/deployment just fail on CI because we use yarn there, but npm and package-lock in this repo?

### 1. Select yarn (or npm)

- Decide on using one of them (_yarn for speed, and monorepo support_). 
- Remove and add the _other_ lock file to `.gitignore`
- Make sure your CI scripts use the same package manager

### 2. Add a script for installing packages ðŸŽ€

Add the script below to your bash profile. This will alias `ins` to install packages in the current repo, using whatever .

`gist:259e3903e924ec64b32aa48e317cd07d#yarn.npm.install.sh`


### 3. Add a script for starting the app ðŸš€

Add the script below to your bash profile. This will alias `sta` to start the repo, with the commonly used dev script that the repo uses.

`gist:259e3903e924ec64b32aa48e317cd07d#yarn.npm.start.sh`
