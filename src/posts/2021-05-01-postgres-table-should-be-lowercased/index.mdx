In Postgres, [unquoted column names are internally lower cased](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21796446/postgres-case-sensitivity).

Therefore, create all tables as with [lower_cased column names](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2878248/postgresql-naming-conventions).

Or else, psql suggestions is broken, and unquoted column selections [break things somewhere](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45253713/camelcase-column-in-postgresql-database-in-rails-activerecord), but [not necessarily in your tool if you configed things your way](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/458).

So don't cling to your language-specific way of doing casing. Postgres columns are Postgres columns â€“ not Javascript columns.
