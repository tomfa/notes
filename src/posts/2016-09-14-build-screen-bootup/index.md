I have a "stupid computer" whos job is only to show a build screen. Its a debian, and I'd like for it to automatically reload the build page every 5 minutes, as well as enter the build screen in case of a reboot. Here's one way to do it.

**1. Install prerequisites**

```bash
apt-get install xdotool
apt-get install iceweasel
```

**2. Add the following to a startupscript (e.g. `~/startup.sh`)**

Place the following code so that it is run when
the machine has booted.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# open build screen url in firefox
iceweasel http://url.to.build.screen.com

# Allow 15 seconds to load
sleep 15;

# Clicks Enter to log in (autofill)
xdotool key KP_Enter

# Click F11 to maximize screen
xdotool key F11

# Loop reload every 5 minutes
while true; sleep 300; xdotool key ctrl+r; done
```

**3A) Add file to startup by appending**

```bash
sudo cp startup.sh /etc/init.d/startup.sh
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/startup.sh
sudo update-rc.d startup.sh defaults
```

**3B) (if you have an LXDE environment)**

```bash
echo "@./startup.sh" >> ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-myuser
```
