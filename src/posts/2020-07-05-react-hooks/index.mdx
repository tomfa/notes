Why do we use useContext? Isn't it just a non-local non-global state? Why do we want to separate it somewhere in the tree? Does it help if we need two different contexts?
- useContext may cause unexpected rerenders https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gUHfe-ETuo
- useContext not performant for frequent updates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvM4hIxrqAw


Why do we use useReducer instead of redux? Isn't it the same basic functionality, but with one store, and no developer tools?

Why do we want to use useRef?

Can we use redux very willy nilly, by creating and using it from within a component? It could be cool due to consistent front end state and debugging?

A common argument against Redux is that it's too easy to share state across the app, so it becomes awkwardly weird when one component uses and changes another one... I conceptually agree. It's a different way of saying: We can create bugs more easily when sharing state, and it can be _difficult to debug_ why state changed when it's all due to some component you're not working on. Rephrasing: REDUX = EASY TO SHARE STATE = THIS IS NOT ALWAYS SMART = ... THEN DONT DO IT? YOU DONT HAVE TO SHARE STATE BECAUSE YOU CAN?

SHould we use useCallback instead of defining functions inside render functions?

Should we use React.memo and React.useMemo for things when and why?
