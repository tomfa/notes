Adding slack as an app in Freshdesk allows you to use observers and dispatcher in freshdesk to notify / recieve data from Slack. **First, add Slack as an app to Freshdesk**

1.  Login to your Freshdesk
2.  Click Admin > Apps > Get more apps [![Freshdesk observer ](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-15.27.24-300x98.png)](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-15.27.24.png)
3.  Search for slack
4.  Add it to your team and channel

#### **Add an dispatcher rule if you want notification when ticket is CREATED**

1.  Click Admin > Dispatcher > New Rule
2.  At the bottom, choose **Push to Slack**, and select your channel
3.  The Message need only be the
    
    ```
    NEW TICKET: {{ticket.url}}
    ```

Luckily, the ticket.url is picked up by slack, and you'll get basic information on the ticket :D [![Slack showing freshdesk ticket](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-16.10.56-300x128.png)](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-16.10.56.png)

#### Add an observer rule if you want notification when ticket is UPDATED

1.  Click Admin > Observer > New Rule
2.  Trigger when e.g. a reply is sent [![Freshdesk observver](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-15.25.44-300x136.png)](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-15.25.44.png)
3.  You might want it to only trigger when the customer replies (not yourself) [![Freshdesk reply is sent](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-16.13.33-300x158.png)](./Screen-Shot-2016-08-02-at-16.13.33.png)
4.  Then, post to Slack. Again, use the url of the ticket, and don't include reply text.
    
    ```
    REPLY: {{ticket.url}}
    ```

There you go. There's also possible to create tickets from slack, but that's not very useful for me, so I'll just refer to the [Freshdesk docs](https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/206103-the-slack-app) for that.
