I was looking for **WEB_CONCURRENCY** environment variable on my Django-app. This is used for the number of concurrent webworkers for gunicorn, and is automatically scaled depending on the memory usage of your app.

I can do it with the [toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/), and the command

```bash
heroku run printenv --app your-app-name | grep WEB_CONCURRENCY
```

For environement variables that are set by us as a setting, the can also be found
with:

```bash
heroku config --app your-app-name
```
