This little JavaScript snippet lets you easily decide (from another javascript function) to show a confirm-dialog (Bootstrap), and functions to be executed on cancel/confirm. Check it out at [https://gist.github.com/tomfa/12bf7651d6a346eb2942](https://gist.github.com/tomfa/12bf7651d6a346eb2942 "I just gist...") Want one made for submit-buttons, link etc?
