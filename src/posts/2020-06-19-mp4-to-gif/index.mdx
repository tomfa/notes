Converting mp4 to gif on can be done with [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/). On a Mac it can be done from command line with the following script:


```bash
# Add this to your ~/.bash_profile file
makeGif() {
    FRAMERATE=12
    SCALE=480

    # Make gif out of video
    if [ "$1" = "" ] ; then
        echo "Missing input video"
        return;
    fi
    if [ -f "$1" ]; then
        echo "$1 exists."
    else
        echo "$1 does not exists."
        return;
    fi
    if ! [ "$2" = "" ] ; then
        FRAMERATE=$2
    fi
    if ! [ "$3" = "" ] ; then
        SCALE=$3
    fi
    type ffmpeg >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "I require ffmpeg but itâ€™s not installed.  Install with 'brew install ffmpeg'" & return }
    ffmpeg -i "$1" -r $FRAMERATE -vf scale="$SCALE":-1 $1.gif
}
alias giphify=makeGif
```

Now you can convert videos with
```
giphify my-video.mp4
```

_Note: you'll have to reopen your terminal first, or source the file_ 

The gif will default to 12 FPS and a 480px width with a pretty hard compression, making it suitable to host online.

If you wish, you can override the FPS and SCALE in the script, or by passing it as the second and third argument:

```bash
# Creating a Gif with 24 FPS and 1080px width.
gipify my-video.mp4 24 1080
```

### An example

#### Original GIF from giphify (*5.2MB*)

![Original gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/DHFUvl7EK111mMKobq/giphy.gif)



#### Directly compressed GIF (*4.4MB*)

![Compressed version of original gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1502702/95243703-4f219800-0811-11eb-9e61-c0480c0963d4.gif)

```
giphify facemask-original.gif
```

#### Quicktime screen capture (*4.1MB .mov*)

<video width="480" autoplay loop>
  <source src="/resources/facemask.mov" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Mac have a built in screen capture tool which is quite handy. You with the default hotkey CMD + SHIFT + 5 or by using QuickTime manually.
Capturing the original gif reduces the file size, but changes the file type to `.mov`.

_When I create GIFs from features in Github PRs, I usually use this, combined with the giphify'ing below._

#### GIF from screen capture (*1.8MB*)

![mov file converted to lower quality gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1502702/95243685-49c44d80-0811-11eb-9811-a19bc42bedf5.gif)

```
giphify screencapture.mov
```

The quality here is notably worse: more choppy, less details and somethings a bit off with colors. I think it's still acceptable for most use cases remaining for GIF images, and most importantly my own use cases :)
