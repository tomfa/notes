I'm glad the "intro curriculum" at my new job includes watching videos from Simon Sinek. Not only are they real good, but it also makes me think the new job is lead with good values.

Extend the circle of safety to the outer parts of the organisation. When employees feels safe and trusted, they can spend they energy being creative and productive. 

**Accomplish this by:**
- Spending time and energy with your colleagues. Talk to them instead of emailing them, be helpful and generous. 
- Avoid politics inside the organisation.
- Don't steal credit or hand out blame
- Have each others backs

### [Millennials in the workplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER0Qp6QJNU&t=9s)

Millennials have grown up in decades filled with instant gratification, parents telling them they're special and constant access to dopamine drips through cell phones and social media, Netflix and Spotify. This takes away from focus on things that take time: building meaningful relationships, self confidence, learning new skills and "making an impact" (whatever that means).

**Tips for millennials:**
- Leave your phone at home, off/silent when you go out with friends.
- Leave your phone outside your bedroom when you go to bed.
- Things that matter do not come easily nor pay off quickly: skills, love, relationships, self confidence and job satisfaction. **But don't forget to work on them.**

**The talk has 2 parts: Empathy and Perspective**. Empathy (the first 20 minutes) is more or less a duplicate of the previous video, Millennials in the workplace, and what they/we need from a workplace: trust and meaningful relationships. _Only difference is that his audience is now shifted from millennials themselves to their parent generation (which is interesting in itself, seeing how he phrases himself a bit differently)_ This is set up in contrast to typical 40 year old business theories like maximising shareholder value â€“ _"It's like a coach prioritising the needs of the fans over the needs of the players"_.

The last 10 minutes is on Perspective: Business is an Infinite game, as opposed to an Finite game. There is no nr. 1 company and you can not "win". It's about the next 50 years, not the next 3 months. A good leader takes a hit a quarter to avoid a mass layoff, and in return gains trust from the employees. Over time, actions like that fosters a feeling of safety in the workplace, a 


### Own thoughts

Simon is great! He's pushing some really good values about caring for each other, patience and about leading with compassion and trust. I also love the moments where one word in his sentence comes out with an English dialect. He's so good at speaking that these short moments stand out :)

- There are too many notifications, on our phones and computers. Turn them off! Nothing burned down because you didn't reply to a notif (It would've burned down because you didn't pick up your phone).
- Care about the people in your life, friends and colleagues. Ask them for help when you need it, notice when things are off and then ask them how they're doing. 

_Last note: Not all his might not apply to startups and scaleups. It could really be about this quarters numbers for non-established companies (disclaimer: I just read [Blitzscaling](https://www.blitzscaling.com/))_
