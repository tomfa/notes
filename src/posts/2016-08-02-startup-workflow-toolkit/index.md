In my imagined startup, everything is running so smooth. You don't need to check anything, you just develop, create, work and do. Anything you should know, comes to you automatically – **automated input;** and any task that can be automated, is – **automated output**. You're not the computer – the computer is.

## Automated input

**1\. I need to know when a team member needs input or offers opinions and input to me.**

- Someone commented on an issue
- Someone created a new issue
- Someone made a pull-request
- Someone commented on my pull-request.

**2\. I need to know when something is wrong with the systems**

- A server returns a 500 Error to a user
- A server has a dangerously high load (unless it autoscales)

**3\. I need to know when someone reaches out to me or the team**

- A user sends an email or replies to support

## **Automated output**

**4\. I need my code to deployed automatically**

- One git branch should deploy to test environment
- One git branch should deploy to prod environment
- If something goes wrong during deploy, I want to know about it asap

**5\. I need my bills to be autogenerated and sent montly**

- I should be able to log hours in Slack for a given project
- Customer bills should be automatically generated and sent.
- I should be notified when customer bills are paid
- I should be notified when customer bills are not paid in time.

### Current solution

First of all, use Slack, on your phone, on your PC.
Then, in order to address the wishes above:

1. In order to keep track of issues and pull-requests, I use [Github](https://github.com/) for issues and [Github-Slack](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7YS2SX-github) integration to get notified of issues and pull-requests.

2. For you to be notified of system errors, the choice should depend on the system size. [AWS Cloudwatch -> Slack](http://ashiina.github.io/2015/06/cloudwatch-lambda-slack/) for large systems, or [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) if advanced logs needed.  For smaller systems, deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and use [Logentries addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/logentries) with [Logentries-Slack](https://slack.com/apps/A0F81FMAA-logentries) integration.

3. In order to keep track of support, use [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/). I made a [post](http://notes.webutvikling.org/adding-freshdesk-to-slack/) on how to integrate it with slack so you'll be notified when action is required.

4. Heroku allows you to [integrate with Github](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration), so does [AWS Code Deploy](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/codedeploy/).

5. I have no clue, honestly. I did however write a [node-freshdesk library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-freshdesk) in 2014, and a post on how to add [hubot to slack](http://notes.webutvikling.org/how-to-add-hubot-to-slack/). So it should be doable to create something. Alternatively, [Hourstack](https://hourstack.io/) and [Mesasix](https://timetracker.mesasix.com/) are time tracking tools that have [slack](https://hourstack.io/integrations/slack) integrations. **These solutions are sweet, and their payment model is suitable for early startups: **

- Github costs 25$ /month for first 5 users. However, it can be replaced with [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) for free.
- Slack is free. You could also upgrade for 6.67$ / month pr. user, which gives customers access to talk to you through slack, unlimited integrations and will save history.
- Freshdesk is free for the first 3 users, then $15 / month pr. user.
- AWS, Heroku and Logentries can be used (as testing) for free\*. Once you go live you should either put som money on the table or start billing your customer.

### Unsolved issues

1.  Should setup testing, so nothing gets deployed to Heroku/AWS without passing tests. This should also notify slack once accepted / declined.
2.  Everything on point number 5. How to timetrack, get reports and create bills automatically?
